\title{Feature Selection and Model Training with Priority Methylation Method}
\usage{
priority_meth(
  data = data,
  label_col = "label",
  split_ratio = 0.7,
  models = c("rf"),
  max_runs_phase1 = 100,
  max_runs_phase2 = 100,
  max_runs_phase3 = 100
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame where features are in columns and samples are in rows. The dependent variable (label) should be included in the data.}

\item{label_col}{A character string specifying the name of the column containing the dependent variable (default is "label").}

\item{split_ratio}{A numeric value for the ratio of data to be used for training (default is 0.7).}

\item{models}{A character vector specifying machine learning models to be used (default is "rf" for random forest).}

\item{max_runs_phase1}{An integer specifying the maximum number of runs for the first phase of Boruta (default is 100).}

\item{max_runs_phase2}{An integer specifying the maximum number of runs for the second phase of Boruta (default is 100).}

\item{max_runs_phase3}{An integer specifying the maximum number of runs for the third phase of Boruta (default is 100).}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
  \item{models}{A list with trained models and their corresponding confusion matrices.}
  \item{umap_df}{A data frame with UMAP results for visualization.}
  \item{final_features}{A data frame with the final selected features.}
  \item{heatmap}{A heatmap object showing methylation beta values.}
  \item{umap_plot}{A ggplot object of the UMAP plot for unsupervised clustering.}
}
}
\description{
This function performs feature selection through iterative Boruta phases, followed by UMAP dimensionality reduction,
machine learning model training, and heatmap visualization of methylation beta values. The data should have features in columns and samples in rows, with the label as the dependent variable.
